# Pro Features - Export

## Export Availability

Export to PDF and high-resolution formats is available on **Pro and Enterprise plans only**. Free plan users see export options greyed out or limited.

## How to Export (Pro / Enterprise)

1. Open the document or project you want to export
2. Click **File > Export** (or the Export icon in the toolbar)
3. Choose format: PDF, PNG, or high-res for presentations
4. Select quality and page range if prompted
5. Click Export and choose where to save the file

Export usually takes a few seconds. For large projects, it may take up to a minute.

## Export for Presentations

If you need export for a presentation or meeting:
- Use **File > Export > PDF** for slides or handouts
- For highest quality: select "High resolution" or "Print quality" in export options
- Export is available as long as you are on Pro or Enterprise and your account is in good standing

If your plan shows Pro but export is still locked, try: log out, clear cache, log back in. If it persists after 10 minutes, contact support—there may be a short delay in plan activation after payment.

## Troubleshooting Export

- **Export button greyed out**: Confirm you are on Pro or Enterprise (Settings > Account). Free plan does not include export.
- **Export fails or times out**: Reduce quality or export in smaller sections. Check your internet connection.
- **Wrong quality**: In export dialog, change the quality or resolution setting before exporting.

# Getting Help and System Status

## Checking System Status

Before contacting support for "can't log in" or "app not working":

1. **Open the status page**: **status.company.com**
2. Check for any incidents (outages, degraded performance, maintenance)
3. If you see "All systems operational" but you still cannot access the app:
   - Try the troubleshooting steps in our Login Errors and System Status article
   - Note your region (e.g. Asia, US, EU)—regional issues may not show on the main status page immediately
   - If multiple people in your organization are affected, mention that when you contact support

Status page updates can lag by a few minutes. If many users report the same issue, we investigate even when the status page still shows green.

## When to Contact Support

- **Auto-respond**: Use when the knowledge base has a clear answer (e.g. how to enable dark mode, how to check your plan, basic troubleshooting steps). Reply with those steps.
- **Route to specialist**: Use when the customer needs billing help (refunds, multiple charges, upgrade problems), infrastructure (login errors, regional outages, error 500), or product (bugs, feature questions we cannot answer from KB).
- **Escalate**: Use for critical urgency, enterprise customers with business impact, or when the customer is very frustrated and needs human follow-up.

## How We Prioritize

- **Enterprise** customers and tickets with business impact (e.g. demo, deal at risk) are prioritized
- **Billing disputes** and multiple charges are handled urgently by the billing team
- **Regional outages** are escalated to infrastructure so we can check CDN and regional servers

When you reply to the customer, you can say: "We've recorded your issue. You can check status at status.company.com. If the problem continues, our [billing/infrastructure/support] team will follow up shortly."

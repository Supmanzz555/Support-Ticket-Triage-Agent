# Performance and Slow Loading

## App Feels Slow or Loads Slowly

If the app is slow when opening or while you use it, try these steps in order.

### Quick Fixes

1. **Refresh the page or restart the app**
   - Close other tabs or apps to free memory
   - Reload the page (F5 or Cmd+R) or quit and reopen the app

2. **Clear cache and cookies**
   - Browser: Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data (cache and cookies for this site)
   - Desktop app: Settings > Advanced > Clear cache
   - Then log in again

3. **Check your connection**
   - Slow or unstable internet can cause loading delays
   - Try another network (e.g. mobile hotspot) to see if speed improves
   - Run a speed test; we recommend at least 5 Mbps for smooth use

4. **Try a different browser or device**
   - If possible, test in Chrome, Safari, or Firefox
   - Rules out browser-specific issues

### Regional or Widespread Slowness

If everyone in your office or region is experiencing slowness:
- Check our status page: **status.company.com**
- Status page may show "Degraded performance" or "Investigating"
- If status says "All systems operational" but you still have issues, it can be a regional problem—report your region (e.g. Asia, US) when you contact support so we can prioritize

### When to Contact Support

Contact support if:
- Slowness continues after trying the steps above
- Only certain pages or actions are slow (we can narrow down the cause)
- You are on Enterprise and need priority investigation
- You have an upcoming presentation or deadline and need a quick check

Support can check server-side performance and regional status on our side.
